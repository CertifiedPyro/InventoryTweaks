## Features

### Menu navigation via keyboard

- Use number keys to navigate top-level menus
  - "1' for inventory, "2" for journal, "3" for outfits, "4" for inbox, and "5" for players
- Use "Q" and "E" keys to navigate submenus
  - e.g. freshwater/saltwater/misc fish under journal, cosmetic categories under outfits, etc.
- Use "Z" and "C" keys to navigate pages

Note that these keybinds support alternative keyboard layouts.
For example, on a French AZERTY keyboard, you would use "A" and "E" to navigate submenus, and "W" and "C" to navigate pages.
